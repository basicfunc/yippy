#+TITLE: Yippy

Yippy is a scripting language in development that is similar to LISP. It's my hobby project, and it's quite interesting since I'm learning a lot of new stuff and how things function behind the scenes.

But why have a language? Isn't it something everyone does when they're bored? Actually, I have some plans for the same, and I hope to get there soon.

* Building
Right now, as of v0.0.1, only =gcc= and =make= is needed to compile this small language.
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make
#+END_SRC
