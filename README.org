#+TITLE: Yippy

Yippy is a scripting language in development that is similar to LISP. It's my hobby project, and it's quite interesting since I'm learning a lot of new stuff and how things function behind the scenes.

* Thanksgiving ðŸ™Œ
This project is heavily inspired by [[https://buildyourownlisp.com/][Build Your Own Lisp]] Book and uses [[https://github.com/orangeduck/mpc][mpc]] to parse the user input.
I really appreciate [[https://github.com/orangeduck][Daniel Holden]]'s work.
This project used to use [[https://github.com/antirez/linenoise][linenoise]] for command line interface written by [[https://github.com/antirez/][Salvatore Sanfilippo]]. But,
now it uses [[https://github.com/arangodb/linenoise-ng/][linenoise-ng]] by [[https://github.com/arangodb/linenoise-ng/][arangodb]] for Windows compatibility.
