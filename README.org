#+TITLE: Yippy

* About
Yippy, a LISP like in-progress programming language. It's my hobby project and it's very intresting as I'm learning a lot of new things and how actually things work under the hood.

But why a Language? Isn't that everyone do when they're bored ??
Actually, I've some plans regarding the same and I hope I'll get there soon.

* Building
Right now, as of v0.0.1, only =gcc= is needed to compile this small language.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make
#+END_SRC
